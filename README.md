They say its a good thing if we learn one new thing everyday, well this demo does just that.

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Fact Brain' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a purple hue background with the title on top 'Fact Brain', right below is a label that says 
'Tap the Brain' in the center and a button below that portrays a happy smiling brain cartoon. 
The user clicks the brain button and a random fact is shown in the label above the brain. 
Then when the brain is clicked again another fact is displayed.
